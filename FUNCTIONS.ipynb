        "  -> List are  mutable because they are designed for flexibility, allowing dynamic modification like adding or removing elements. Tuples are immutable to provide data integrity, memory efficiency, and Hashability, making them ideal for fixed collections. This Distinction aligns with their intended use cases: List are for changeable data and tuples for constant and stable data.\n",

        "#9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Type casting in Python is the process of converting one data type to another. It can be done implicitly (automatically by Python) or explicitly (using built-in functions). Common functions for explicit casting include `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `list()`, and `tuple()`. Implicit casting happens when a smaller data type (like `int`) is converted to a larger one (like `float`) without loss of data. Explicit casting is required when converting between incompatible types. Incorrect casting, such as converting a non-numeric string to an integer, results in an error.\n",

        "\n",

        "# 11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "  -> In Python, conditional statements are used to make decisions in code based on certain conditions. These statements allow you to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false. They enable your program to react dynamically to various inputs, conditions, or states, making your code more flexible and capable of handling different situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "  -> The `elif` statement in Python is used to check multiple conditions in sequence. If the initial `if` condition is **False**, it evaluates the `elif` conditions one by one. As soon as an `elif` condition is **True**, its block of code executes, and the rest of the conditions are skipped. If no conditions are true, the `else` block (if present) is executed.\n",

        "# 13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "  ->The key difference between for and while loops lies in how the loop control is handled:\n",
        "\n",
        "  for loop: It is used when the number of iterations is known in advance or when iterating over a sequence (like a list, range, or string). It automatically handles the initialization, condition checking, and incrementing.\n",
        "\n",
        "  while loop: It is used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand, and it continues to run as long as a given condition remains True. The loop condition is checked before each iteration.\n",

        "# 14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "  ->A `while` loop is more suitable when the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on a condition that may change during execution. For example, when waiting for user input or checking for a specific condition:\n",
        "\n",
